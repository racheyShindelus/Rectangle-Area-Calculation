# Rectangle Area Calculator

This C program calculates the area of a rectangle based on user input for its height and width.

## How it Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter the height and width of the rectangle.
2. It reads the input height and width.
3. It calculates the area of the rectangle using the formula: `area = height * width`.
4. Finally, it prints the calculated area of the rectangle.

## Notes

- The program calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying its height and width.
- It assumes that the user enters valid integers for the height and width.
- It demonstrates basic arithmetic operations and user input processing.
